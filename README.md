# React_rest_api
Web application with React and Node JS.

Basically a Web App created with MERN Stack

A CRUD application by creating REST API on backend and using React JS on the frontend. The application also uses JWT (Json Web Tokens) for authentication purpose. However, the tokens are stored on the local storage of the browser which I believe is a bit unsafe but its just for learning purpose.

On the frontend, a little of CSS is being used with React Material Ui just for a clean look with success and error validations..

Running the application:
After extracting the zip file, from the project directory start the server by running 'cd server' and then 'nodemon'.
From another terminal window start the client by running 'cd client' and 'npm install' then 'npm start'.
Your application should run on http://localhost:3000

Note: Save the two font family to ur system for better look..and please view it on desktop..
